# a demo of a multi-facetted service handler.
# even though the handler responds by name to a request of service a,
# it installs two more facettes of its operation.
# the additional facettes are services foo and bar

# @FACETTE foo bar

# service requested can be test, foo or bar.
# figure out which one was requested:
echo "service requested: $service"

echo "xxx group"
#echo "$f"
#echo "$@"
#xxx group
