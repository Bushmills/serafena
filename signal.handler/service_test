# a demo of a multi-facetted service handler.
# even though the handler responds by name to a request of service a,
# it installs two more facettes of its operation.
# the additional facettes are services foo and bar

# @INSTALL echo "INSTALL tag of service $service found and executed on $HOSTNAME by $SHELL"
# @UPDATE echo "UPDATE tag of service $service found and executed on $HOSTNAME by $SHELL"
# @UNINSTALL echo "UNINSTALL tag of service $service found and executed on $HOSTNAME by $SHELL"

# service requested can be test, foo or bar.
# figure out which one was requested:
# @FACETTE foo bar
echo "service requested: $service"
