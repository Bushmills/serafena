package and transfer an installer archive,
consisting of an install script, and all
files for a basic serafena host.
The installer script will put all files into
place and configure serafena for that host.

for bootstrap, the commandline to start installation
will be printed, for copy and paste execution.

This may look like:

nc $pool $port <<< "pool installer "
