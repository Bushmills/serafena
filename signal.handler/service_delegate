# optmisation potential: service delegate on servicebroker doesn't need to
# signal servicebroker - instead, being servicebroker itself, it can
# delegate directly.
# think about replacing delegate service against optimised version.
# this could be done by service_servicebroker

# will probably drop these completely, and instead of:
#           signal localhost delegate service args
# go to
#           signal @serviceprovider delegate service args
