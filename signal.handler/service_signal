# signal a service request to host 
#
# @HELP signal host signal host service args
#
# mostly meant to provide an interface for a script, meant for
# interactively sending service requests, while that script should
# use the signal function provided in server script "dispatch".
# as dispatch is already executed by the "sl" (signal localhost) script,
# offering a service request to signal other hosts seemed least effort.
# therefore, most likely invocation is probably:
#
# sl signal host service args
#

signal $@
