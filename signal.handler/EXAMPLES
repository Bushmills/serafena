# create a group from hosts providing a specific service,
# goal is to send a service request to those hosts which will reply to it
# for this example, the diagnostic service "hostname" is used.

# first, query providers of service "hostname", and assign those to the group "hosts":

              signal @all   group hosts = $(sl provider hostname)


# now send service request to members of group "hosts":

              signal @hosts   hostname


# scripts acting as shortcuts for "signal" and "signal @all" exist:

#             s  = signal
#             sl = signal localhost
#             sa = signal @all

# therefore this is equivalent:
              sa group hosts = $(sl provider hostname)
              s @hosts hostname
