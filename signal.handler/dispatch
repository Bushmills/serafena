# --- service dispatch ---
# -----------------------

# 20170608ls: c0.1.3 factored into function dispatch, which is called from callback. this solves the problem of callbacks happening
#                    too early when netcat timed out: dispatch was signalling (using netcat) before. Dropped some yet unused authentication
#                    provisions for this.
# 20170607ls: v0.1.2 reporting unknown requests through stderr.  /etc/*.conf vor service vor /etc/*.conf2
# 20170607ls: v0.1.1 started letting group calls through % use callbacks. Appears functional, but only little testing has been done.
# 2016andbefore: v0.0.1 - v0.1.0 initial versions.  Accumulated changes lead to v0.1.1
