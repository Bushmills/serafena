# service is requested by a servicebroker when host joins
# purpose of this service is to trigger inclusion of a possibly existing /etc/serafena.welcome.conf:
#   /etc/serafena.<service>.conf will be looked for if <service> is provided by host
#   for this reason is this service as such a dummy.
#   /etc/serafena.welcome.conf can therefore contain a host specific welcome procedure
# @HELP signal host welcome       # only a servicebroker should do that - may want to consider "hidden" services.
