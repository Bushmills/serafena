# service is requested by a servicebroker when host joins
# @HELP signal host welcome       # only a servicebroker should do that - may want to consider "hidden" services.

echo "$(date): $HOSTNAME received welcome" >> /tmp/foo
cat << EOF
$HOSTNAME reveived welcome service request after it has joined.
What it should do now is:"
- check local custom area for anything $HOSTNAME wishes to be done
- tell servicebroker how to undo anything done above
EOF

# things which could be done:
# add host to specific @groups, like the @munin or @backup group
# register local devices with brokers, such as power strips with power brokers
# volunteer or apply for specific roles, like become a broker
