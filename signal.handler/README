service_pool and service_update are no good pool candidates, because
both are executed for service_update operation, and may, therefore,
overwrite themselves, while they are running. This tends to mess things
up, and needs to be fixed prior to re-adding those two services to
the pool again.
For now, the more pedestrian method of running:
   for h in cubie banana odroid radxa raspberry buffalo; do
      scp /etc/xinetd.d/signal.handler/pool/service_update $h:/etc/xinetd.d/signal.handler
   done
is the recommended alternative.
