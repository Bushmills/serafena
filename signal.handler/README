service_update is no good pool candidates, because
it may overwrite itself when a new version of service_update
is found in pool.

An "update" script which deals with this specific case for the
time being has been written, which selectively syncs the update
service handler with hosts.

execute permission is unset on services pool and update.
Only services with the execute permission set are considered updateable.
By not setting that flag, pool and update are excempted from getting updated.

fping -uq -r1 -t1 $(sl group all)  pings all hosts in group all and prints those which don't reply.
