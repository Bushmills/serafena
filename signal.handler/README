service_update and service_pool are no good pool candidates, because
they may get overwritten by themselved when a new version is found in pool.

An "update" script which deals with this specific case for the
time being has been written, which selectively syncs the update
service handler with hosts. That script has been integrated into
the "serafena" maintenance utility, and is called "serafena update"

execute permission is unset on services pool and update.
Only services with the execute permission set are considered updateable.
By not setting that flag, pool and update are exempted from getting updated.
