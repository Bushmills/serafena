              - there exists no dependency mechanism for fragments, therefore no way to determine which fragments are needed for what purpose.
                thinking of locally caching fragments after they were requested, because needed, once.
                this may be an option for service handlers too, if host allows that.

              - avoid broadcasts, they don't scale well. Use brokers instead.

              - change request protocol to include information on who requested. This information is needed for call backs.

 X            - pretend groups. their members are a result of some rule, not of static assignment.
                examples:  
 X                  @others        -  that's  @all less $myself
 X                  @pool          -   hosts maintaining a collection of services
 X                  @servicebroker - hosts maintaining a host<>services database
                    @permanent     -  hosts with an higher than average uptime
