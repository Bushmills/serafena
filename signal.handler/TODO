 X            - intrinsic groups. their members are a result of some rule, not of static assignment.
                examples:  
 X                  @others        -  that's  @all less $myself
 X                  @pool          -   hosts maintaining a collection of services
 X                  @servicebroker - hosts maintaining a host<>services database
                    @permanent     -  hosts with an higher than average uptime
